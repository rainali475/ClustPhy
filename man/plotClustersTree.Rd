\usage{
plotClustersTree(
  tree,
  clustering,
  col.palette = NULL,
  show.centers = NULL,
  center.symbol = " * ",
  symbol.cex = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo tree object.}

\item{clustering}{An positive integer vector, usually the from the output of
clustPAM, indicating index of specific colors from the palette. The
integers in this vector must be at most the length of palette. Values of
0 indicate that the node is not assigned a cluster and therefore will not
be labeled. If show.centers is not NULL, then all cluster centers
indicated in the show.centers must not have a clustering value of 0.
clustering should be the same length as the number of leaves in the tree.}

\item{col.palette}{A character vector indicating the colors used for different
clusters. If no value is given, the palette will be generated from
rainbow.}

\item{show.centers}{A character vector indicating leaf names of the cluster
centers. Default value is NULL.}

\item{center.symbol}{A character vector indicating the symbol or text
representative of the cluster centers. Default value is " * ". If the length
of center.symbol is less than the number of cluster centers specified in
show.centers, then the symbols are recycled. This argument is ignored
when show.centers is NULL.}

\item{symbol.cex}{A numeric indicating factor scaling of center symbols.
Default value is 1. This can be a numeric vector indicating scaling of
each symbol. If the vector is shorter than the number of cluster centers,
the numbers will be recycled. This argument is ignored if show.centers is
NULL.}
}
\value{
plot a tree with different colors indicating different clusters.
}
\description{
A function that plots a phylogenetic tree with a given clustering scheme and
given options of coloring scheme, label sizes, and whether to show the leaf
names.
