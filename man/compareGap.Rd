\title{Compare different clusterings of the same phylogenetic tree using gap
statistics.}
\usage{
compareGap(distM, k.max, clusterings = NULL, B = 100L, method = "PAM")
}
\arguments{
\item{distM}{A distance matrix of tree leaves.}

\item{k.max}{An integer that is at least 2, indicating the max number of
clusters desired for the tree.}

\item{clusterings}{A list of k.max - 1 positive integer vectors. Each
positive integer vector is usually the clustering output of clustPAM or
clustEM, in which each leaf node is associated with an integer
representing the cluster it is assigned. Each positive integer vector
must be the same length as the number of leaves in the tree. Clustering
vectors must indicate the clustering scheme of the tree from 2 clusters
(k = 2) to k.max clusters (k = k.max). Clustering vectors must be
ordered in the list by increasing number of clusters. Default value of
clusterings is NULL, in which case EM or PAM clustering will be performed
on distM over 2 <= k <= k.max depending on the method argument.}

\item{B}{An integer indicating the number of bootstrap samples. Default
value is 100.}

\item{method}{A character string that is either "PAM" or "EM", indicating
the clustering method in case clustering is not given. This argument is
ignored if clustering is given. Default value is "PAM".}
}
\value{
An S3 object of "clusGap" with gap statistics.
}
\description{
A function that compares a set of clustering schemes by PAM or EM and
computes the gap statistics from a given range of k.
}
\examples{
pam <- clustPAM(6, text = NwkTree2)
set.seed(5)
gapStat <- compareGap(distM = pam$distM, k.max = 10, method = "PAM")
gapStat$Tab
set.seed(NULL)
