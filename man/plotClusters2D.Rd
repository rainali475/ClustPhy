\title{Plot phylogenetic tree clusters as a 2D graph}
\usage{
plotClusters2D(
  tree,
  clustering,
  col.palette = NULL,
  show.centers = NULL,
  center.symbol = " * ",
  symbol.cex = 1,
  maxDim = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo tree object.}

\item{clustering}{An positive integer vector, usually the from the output of
clustEM, indicating index of specific colors from the palette. The
integers in this vector must be at most the length of palette. Values of
0 indicate that the node is not assigned a cluster and therefore will not
be labeled. If show.centers is not NULL, then all cluster centers
indicated in the show.centers must not have a clustering value of 0.
clustering should be the same length as the number of leaves in the tree.}

\item{col.palette}{A character vector indicating the colors used for different
clusters. If no value is given, the palette will be generated from
rainbow.}

\item{show.centers}{A character vector indicating leaf names of the cluster
centers. Default value is NULL.}

\item{center.symbol}{A character vector indicating the symbol or text
representative of the cluster centers. Default value is " * ". If the length
of center.symbol is less than the number of cluster centers specified in
show.centers, then the symbols are recycled. This argument is ignored
when show.centers is NULL.}

\item{symbol.cex}{A numeric indicating factor scaling of center symbols.
Default value is 1. This can be a numeric vector indicating scaling of
each symbol. If the vector is shorter than the number of cluster centers,
the numbers will be recycled. This argument is ignored if show.centers is
NULL.}

\item{maxDim}{A positive integer that is at least 2, indicating the max
dimension of the coordinates that represent tree leaves. The dimensions
will be less than or equal to the number of leaves. The default value of
maxDim is NULL, for which the full dimension will be used. maxDim can be
set smaller to decrease runtime of PCA at the cost of discarding the
least significant dimensions beyond maxDim.}
}
\value{
Returns a biplot of different clusters with different colors and
an S3 object of class treeDimred with the coordinate matrix and PCA results.
\itemize{
\item coordM - The coordinate matrix representation of tree leaves in
n-dimensional space.
\item PCA - A list of 5 elements containing results from principle
component analysis.
}
}
\description{
A function that plots clusters on a 2D graph using dimensionality reduction
by PCA, with a given clustering and options of coloring scheme and whether
to show the leaf names.
