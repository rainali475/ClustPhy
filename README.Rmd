# ClustPhy

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Description

`ClustPhy` is an R package for clustering phylogenetic trees (using PAM or EM 
clustering), comparing different clusterings (using gap statistics), and 
visualizing the clusters (in a phylogenetic tree or in a 2D biplot). 


## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rainali475/ClustPhy", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("TestingPackage")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
Under construction
```

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:ClustPhy")
data(package = "ClustPhy")
```

There are 6 functions available in this package. There are 2 clustering functions: 
__*clustPAM*__ and __*clustEM*__. They allow users to input phylogenetic trees
in newick format either as a character string or a file path and performs clustering
via either PAM (k-medoids) or EM (expectation maximization) algorithms. Users can
specify the number of clusters they want. 
The functions __*plotClustersTree*__ 
and __*plotClusters2D*__ can be used to visualize tree clusters on a phylogram or
a 2D biplot, respectively. Users can specify whether or not to show a number of 
designated cluster centers, the symbols used to represent these centers, and the
text size for these symbols. __*plotClusters2D*__ first converts the distance
matrix of the tree to a coordinate matrix, then uses principle component analysis
to reduce dimensionality of the matrix to plot data points on a 2-dimensional plot.
The __*compareGap*__ function takes as input a distance matrix representation of 
phylogenetic tree and outputs a set of gap statistics for a range from 1 cluster to
k.max clusters. This can be used to select the best clustering scheme for the target
tree.
The __*plotGapStat*__ function takes the gap statistics output from __*compareGap*__
and produces a plot of the gap statistics with a vertical dashed line representing 
the best number of clusters. 

Refer to package vignettes for more details.

## Contributions 

The author of this package is Yuzi (Raina) Li. The __*clustPAM*__ function
makes use of the PAM clustering function in `cluster` to find clusterings and 
clusteri statistics. The __*clustEM*__ function makes use of the `mclust` package 
for EM clustering algorithms. The __*plotClustersTree*__ uses plot.phylo function
from `ape`. __*plotClusters2D*__ uses the algorithm described in
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/156161/finding-the-coordinates-of-points-from-distance-matrix. 
to convert the distance matrix to coordinate matrix. __*compareGap*__ uses the 
clusGap function available in `cluster` package to calculate gap statistics. 
__*plotGapStat*__ uses `factoextra` package to plot the gap statistics and find 
the best k value.
